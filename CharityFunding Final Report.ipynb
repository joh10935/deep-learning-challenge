order to predict the most successful ventures to fund. Using a neural network model, I attempted to predict the success of potential ventures with 75% accuracy or higher.\n","\n","\n","Data Preprocessing:\n","- The target variable in this model is the \"IS_SUCCESSFUL\" column\n","- The feature variables in this model are: APPLICATION_TYPE, AFFILIATION, CLASSIFICATION, USE_CASE, ORGANIZATION, STATUS, INCOME_AMT, SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS, and ASK_AMT.\n","- Variables that were dropped were EIN and NAME\n","\n","\n","Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model:\n","- I chose 3 hidden relu layers and 1 sigmoid output layer. For the first relu layer, I chose 90 nodes. For the second and third relu layers, I chose 30 nodes. I tried different combinations of layers and nodes and this combination gave me the best results. Eventually I decided to proceed with optimizing the model before further adjusting the layers.\n","- Initially I was not able to achieve the target performance (>75% accuracy). After further optimization, I was able to get a little closer to the 75% accuracy mark, but was ultimately unable to achieve this.\n","- I initially let the keras_tuner run with only 20 epochs, which took just over an hour to complete. The results were still below 75%, so I increased the epochs to 50. This took a long time to complete. I went through a few different trials after the initial optimization to adjust the hyperparameters. Ultimately the increases to the overall accuracy were marginal.\n","\n","Summary:\n","- Overall, my deep learning model achieved an accuracy of 73.4%. I did not have any luck with adjusting the hyperparameters and activation methods to improve my results. The only alternative recommendations I have are to try increasing the number of epochs. Another idea I had was to use the .getdummies function on the 'NAME' column and include that in the data I use for the model. However, I believe that would increase the time for the keras_tuner to run. It was already taking over an hour for each optimization analysis. If I had more time, I would explore these alternatives to see if they can increase the accuracy of the model.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"E16OFz3lXchC"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"HjbLSPdg6wOI"}}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.9.12"},"colab":{"provenance":[]}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
